    "text": "Overview\nThe science of social networks focuses on measuring, modeling, and understanding the different ways that people are connected to one another. In this class, we will use a broad toolkit of theories and methods drawn from the social, natural, and mathematical sciences to learn what a social network is, to understand how to work with social network data, and to illustrate some of the ways that social networks can be useful in theory and in practice. We will see that network ideas are powerful enough to be used everywhere from CDC and UNAIDS, where network models help epidemiologists prevent the spread of HIV, to Silicon Valley, where data scientists use network ideas to build products that enable people all across the globe to connect with one another.\nPlease re-check the syllabus frequently; it will be updated as the semester progresses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheme\nWeek\nDate\nTopic\nDemo\nLab\nHwk\n\n\n\n\nIntro + Personal Networks\n1\nThu, Aug 29\nIntro / what social networks are / basic graph theory / class info\n\n\nLab 0: Test submitting a lab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nTue, Sep 3\nPersonal networks; social connectedness and social isolation in America\n\n\nLab 1: Getting started w/ Jupyter notebooks; working with complete network data\nHwk 1: Collecting personal network survey data\n\n\nNetwork structure: foundations\n2\nThu, Sep 5\nTriadic closure, strength of weak ties\nTriadic closure in an email network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nTue, Sep 10\nSocial capital and structural holes\nStrength of weak ties demo\nLab 2: Review of bootstrap, analyzing personal network data\nHwk 2: Analyzing personal network surveys\n\n\n\n\n3\nThu, Sep 12\nNetworks in context; homophily; positive and negative networks\nStructural balance demo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nTue, Sep 17\nIntro to mathematical network models; the Erdos-Renyi model and its predictions\nER random networks demo\nLab 3: Enriching network data and testing a hypothesis about homophily\nHwk 3: TODO - Jupyter-based, hypothesis test\n\n\n\n\n4\nThu, Sep 19\nMore models: configuration model and stochastic block model\nMore random network models demo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall worlds\n5\nTue, Sep 24\nNetwork centrality / the Friendship Paradox\n\n\nTODO - Lab 4, maybe small worlds?\nHwk 4: TODO - written hwk, including graph theory + mathematical models?\n\n\n\n\n5\nThu, Sep 26\nSmall worlds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nTue, Oct 1\nSearch in small worlds\n\n\nTODO - two-mode network lab/hwk?\nHwk 5: ?

    "text": "Requirements\n\nLectures\nLectures will introduce and develop key theoretical and technical concepts in the study of social networks. To illustrate these ideas, some of the lectures will have a live lab component, where we will interactively discuss and work through an analysis in a Jupyter notebook. These live labs will help us explore and develop intuition about key concepts in the course.\nThe lectures are organized so that the first set of material, up to the mid-term exam, is a survey of the core theories, concepts, and methods needed to be familiar with social networks. After the mid-term, the lectures will turn to an exploration of how these core ideas have been used, modified, and deepened in several different topic areas.\nYou are responsible for all of the material covered in lectures, as well as any announcements made there.\n\n\nRequired readings\nThe course readings will include selections from the textbook Networks, Crowds, and Markets by Easley and Kleinberg:\n\nDavid Easley and Jon Kleinberg Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World (Cambridge University Press, 2010), https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/.\n\nWe will also read chapters from popular science books written by leading network researchers, including selections from\n\nD. J. Watts Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age (WW Norton & Company, 2003).\nHelen Epstein The Invisible Cure: Why We Are Losing the Fight Against AIDS in Africa (Macmillan, 2008).\n\nFinally, we will read several journal and newspaper articles.\nThe readings serve two purposes: (1) they provide an introduction and reference for key concepts that we will need to study social networks; (2) they illustrate how social network ideas get used in real world research and applications across many different disciplines. You are expected to do the reading before each class. Whenever possible, PDFs of the readings will be posted on the bCourses site.\n\n\nHomeworks and labs\nThere will be a total of 6 to 8 homework assignments and a similar number of labs. The homeworks and labs are a critical part of the learning you will do in this class: they give you an opportunity to explore the topics we cover in the readings and in lecture on your own. They also give you a chance to practice your writing and your data analysis and programming skills. Most homeworks and labs will ask you to provide some written arguments and to solve some problems by writing Python code in a Jupyter notebook. It can be helpful and educational to discuss the assignments with other students in the class, but (1) all of the work should be your own (i.e., you are not allowed to just copy code, answers, or arguments); (2) you should make a note of the names of the other students you worked with when handing your assignments in.\nLabs are graded based on effort; therefore, you can get full credit on a lab even if you do not get all of the answers right. Labs must be handed in on time for full credit.\nHomeworks are graded on correctness and must be handed in on time for full credit. However, we will drop the homework with the lowest score; thus, you can miss handing in one homework over the course of the semester without it affecting your grade.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two in-class closed book examinations. The mid-term examination will be held during normal class time in our normal classroom; the timing of this midterm will be designed to assess your mastery of the core concepts in social networks. The final will be held during the final exam period (see the date/time above). The final exam will be cumulative.\n\n\nQuizzes\nWe will post a small number (2-4) quizzes on bCourses over the semester. These quizzes will consist of 5-10 multiple choice questions; the goal of these quizzes will be to ensure that you are staying up to date with the reading and lecture materials covered in the class (including guest lectures).\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nComponent\n% of grade\n\n\n\n\nHomeworks (you can drop your lowest score)\n30\n\n\nLabs\n20\n\n\nMid-term exam\n20\n\n\nFinal exam\n25\n\n\nQuizzes\n5"
